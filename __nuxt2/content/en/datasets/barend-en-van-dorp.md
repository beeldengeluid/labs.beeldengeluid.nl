Politics, culture and sports, in short, all facets of life are discussed at the table of Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp, always assisted by former football player and columnist Jan Mulder. Besides Jan Mulder, writer Boudewijn Büch and political reporter Frits Wester are regular guests; they regularly join the table. Initially, the programme was recorded in a café/restaurant in Eemnes. Later, the recordings moved to Gooiland and, since 2002, the broadcasts have been made from the Media Park. In a cosy atmosphere, with nuts on the table. Remarkable guests, emotional subjects and striking statements make Barend & Van Dorp a must see. In total 960 episodes are made. In 2008 Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp transferred all episodes of the talkshow to the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision.
