Waisda? is a video labeling game where players watch videos and add tags about what they see and hear. They play against other players and when they give the same tag they're given points. With this form of crowdsourcing detailed metadata is obtained which is linked to a specific time code within a video.

The game was developed within WP 4 PrestoPRIME in collaboration with KRO and the VU University Amsterdam. The software was developed by Q42.
