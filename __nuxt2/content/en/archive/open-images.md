Open Images is an open media platform that offers online access to audiovisual archive material to stimulate creative reuse. Footage from audiovisual collections can be downloaded and remixed into new works. Users of Open Images also have the opportunity to add their own material to the platform and thus expand the collection.

The collection contains newsreels from the Polygoon collection and several other films on the Netherlands in the twentieth century. It contains historical news events, with topics such as art, culture, transportation, health and healthcare, nature, politics, sports, pets and fashion. Access to the material on Open Images is provided under the Creative Commons [http://www.creativecommons.org/] licensing model.
