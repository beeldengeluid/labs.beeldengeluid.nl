As audiovisual archives are digitizing their collections and making these collections available online, the need arises to also establish connections between different collections and to allow for cross-collection search and browsing. Structured vocabularies can be used as connecting points by aligning thesauri from different institutions. The project "Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus voor Uniforme Ontsluiting" was funded by the Taalunie and executed by the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision and the Flemish [VIAA archive](http://viaa.be/en/about-viaa/).
