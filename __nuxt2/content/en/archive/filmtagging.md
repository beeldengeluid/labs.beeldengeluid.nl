Filmtagging is a crowdsourced tag collection platform in which tags are gathered over a wide variety of old films. Film experts are able to export the tags to use for various research activities. The goal of the platform is to collect as many tags as possible, which are related to three specific categories: cinematography, cultural history and locations.
