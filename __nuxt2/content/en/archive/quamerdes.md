QuaMeRDES is a CLARIN-NL](http://www.clarin.nl/) project and is developing a tool to analyse and compare the content of Dutch television programmes and newspapers. Scholars such as media researchers, historians, and digital humanists will be able to use the QuaMeRDES-demonstrator to explore, analyse and compare the content of Dutch television programmes and newspaper articles. Further, a new feature will enrich the iMMix catalogue of Sound & Vision (i.e. the catalogue with metadata descriptions) with subtitle files. These subtitles enable users to search for and analyse the dialogues and voice-overs of television programmes. At an analytical level, subtitles can be understood as discourses, similar to those of articles in newspapers. One could investigate, for instance, how comedians in a comedy show on television talk about the topic of migration. In addition, these discourses can be compared with journalists' discourses on migration in newspapers. At the same time, the newspapers can provide a political and social context for the way in which migration is discussed in the comedy show.
