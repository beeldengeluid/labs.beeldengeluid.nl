Instead of typing keywords in a search bar, we would rather have a chat with a (virtual) librarian and express our 'information need' or interest in certain content in the archive in a conversation. At Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision, we investigate several use cases in the area of _Spoken Conversational Search_ (SCS) as a means to guide access to our rich but also large and heterogeneous audiovisual archive. In our **LABS** environment, we have search APIs built on top of indices of rich metadata that can be connected to a dialogue system that uses keyboard or speech input to communicate with users online and in our museum.

Research questions we can think of:

- how to represent the 'librarian's knowledge' of the contents of the archive so that it can be used in an SCS system?
- which type of use benefits the most from an SCS approach?
- What are the ethical and legal aspects of conversational AI?
- how to encode multimodal dialogue status and model the evolving 'information need' of a user that communicates with the system and receives information from it?
- would it already be possible to develop a 'convincing system' for museum visitors with a simple approach that uses a search API or the Open Images metadata set?
- how to personalise a dialogue based on additional information sources (e.g., a camera that spots a child)?
- how to optimize voice processing of a dialogue system in a Museum environment?
- how to implement a search dialogue in a VR environment with the librarian as an omnipresent oracle?
- could we enrich the information of archival content by using the information we obtain from the human-computer dialogue?

Please contact us if you are interested to engage with our data and APIs for your research or development project. A relatively straightforward starting point could be harvesting and indexing our [Open Images data set](https://labs.beeldengeluid.nl/api/dbd1c7ee-edb3-11e4-8099-005056a71e3a).
