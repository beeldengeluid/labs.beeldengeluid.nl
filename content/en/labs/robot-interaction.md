In collaboration with the Beeld & Geluid museum team we are running a lab on robot interaction with the aim to investigate how robots could play a role as 'virtual librarians' that guide visitors of our museum and archive. Typically, we focus on technical feasibility, the added value for our users, specifically specific user groups such as children or the elderly, and responsible design.

Currently, two PhD students from University of Twente are investigating robots as a means to communicate with children about the contents of the archive in an engaging and enjoyable way, that is also responsible by design.
