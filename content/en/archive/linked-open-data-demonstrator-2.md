In Linked Open Data Demonstrator 2 (LODD2) a service is developed to link different vocabularies, such as thesauri and term lists, and built a demonstrator that demonstrates relevant end-user applications based on this service. The underlying idea is that these links make it possible for heritage institutions to enrich the digital representations of their collections with sources from other heritage institutions. The project is more than just building a demonstrator, it is a demonstrator of a full-featured service that can be taken into use immediately.
