Sound Connections allows you to explore sounds from across the UK and the Netherlands around different themes:

- Birdlife in the UK and Netherlands
- Aviation in the Netherlands
- Citylife in Amsterdam
- Citylife in London

These sounds have been shared by the British Library and The Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision and they need your help to add contextual information to them. These could be photographs, videos, other sound recordings, articles, or other pieces of relevant information.
