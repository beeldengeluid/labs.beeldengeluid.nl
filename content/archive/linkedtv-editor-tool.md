The LinkedTV Editor Tool (ET) offers a dashboard for broadcaster programme teams to utilize LinkedTV's automatically generated annotations to quickly produce high quality contextual information queues for their viewers. In the course of the project, the ET architecture has been improved to enable plugging into different publication systems, enrichment APIs, video streaming systems etc, increasing its flexibility to support various use-cases.

The Editor Tool was built by The Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision in close collaboration with the LinkedTV consortium.

An open trial version is available using open video. Full access is only available for content providers.
