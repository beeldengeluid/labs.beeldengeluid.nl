The purpose of AXES is to develop tools for different user groups to provide new ways of access to audiovisual archive material, particularly in the area of searching, browsing, navigating and enriching archive material. Three axes are central in the project: users, audiovisual archive material and technology. In the search system various sources, such as wiki's, are automatically linked to descriptions of audiovisual material. In this way the existing metadata is enriched and the material is accessible via a new level.

During the project, three different versions are being developed, each for a different user:

- media professionals
- education & research
- the general public.

The project started in 2011, takes 4 years and is funded by the FP7 Framework Programme of the European Union.
