DIVE+ builds on the results of DIVE for the expansion of the innovative approach for interaction, interpretation and exploration of digital heritage of different online collections. It provides a basis for interpretation support in searching and browsing of heritage objects, where semantic information from existing collections plus open linked data vocabularies are linking collections of objects to the events, people, locations and concepts that are depicted or associated with those objects. An innovative interface allows for browsing this network of data in an intuitive fashion supporting both digital humanities scholars and general audiences in their online explorations.

DIVE+ is funded by the <a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Netherlands eScience center</a>.
