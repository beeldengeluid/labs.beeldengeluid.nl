LinkedTV is an integrated and practical approach towards experiencing Networked Media in the Future Internet. Future vision of LinkedTV is of a ubiquitously online cloud of Networked Audio-Visual Content decoupled from place, device or source. Accessing audio-visual programming will be &"TV" regardless whether it is seen on a TV set, smartphone, tablet or personal computing device, regardless of whether it is coming from a traditional or new media broadcaster, a Web video portal or a user-sourced media platform.
