DIVE is a linked-data digital cultural heritage collection browser. It was developed to provide innovative access to heritage objects from heterogeneous collections, using historical events and narratives as the context for searching, browsing and presenting of individual and groups of objects.

The DIVE demonstrator uses semantics from existing collection vocabularies and linked data vocabularies to establish connections between the collection media objects and the events, people, locations and concepts that are depicted or associated with those objects. Content from two cultural heritage institutions are enriched, linked and made available in the application:

A subset of [the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/) collection was made available using the OAI-PMH protocol. These are videos of news broadcasters. For these videos descriptive metadata is available including free-text content description.

The [National Library of the Netherlands](https://www.kb.nl/) provides access to the [ANP News Bulletin dataset](http://www.delpher.nl/nl/radiobulletins/). This dataset is made up of digitized typoscripts (radio news scripts, to be read during news broadcasts) from the period 1937-1984. These have been made public through a Web interface and API. The scanned images, OCRed content and descriptive metadata is available. The original data and metadata are available in Dutch.

The DIVE tool has been rebuild for the [CLARIAH Media Suite](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/).
